***WorkflowIQ - AI-Powered Business Process Automation Platform.***

An intelligent system that watches how employees work and automatically generates custom automation workflows. Think Zapier meets AI observability - it learns from user behavior and suggests/implements process improvements without manual setup.

**The Problem We're Solving**

73% of knowledge workers spend 2+ hours daily on repetitive tasks
Small businesses lose $50,000+ annually per employee due to process inefficiencies
89% of automation attempts fail because they require too much technical expertise
Most teams don't realize 40-60% of their manual work could be automated

The real insight: businesses don't need another integration toolâ€”they need an intelligent observer that understands their workflows and builds solutions proactively.
